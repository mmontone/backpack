To compile and load Rucksack and make sure that the basics are working:

1. Make sure you have ASDF (Another System Definition Facility) loaded.

2. Load backpack.asd.

3. Load tests/backpack-test.asd.

4. (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :backpack-test)

5. (in-package :backpack-test)

6. (run-tests)


* The tutorial

The tutorial by Brad Beveridge (in doc/backpack-tutorial.lisp) is a
good next step.
